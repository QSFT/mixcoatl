REST Utilities
--------------

The REST utilities are provided as a means to interact with the DCM API in a
very low-level manner, typically by passing raw XML or JSON payloads to an API
URI.

While likely not suitable for building complex work flows, the REST utilities
will be very helpful in learning how the API works and for troubleshooting.
